          My name is Basit B Adebayo with AltSchool ID ALT/SOE/024/1158, I am a
          native of Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria. I studied Civil Engineering at the "Better by far" university,
          University of Ilorin, Ilorin, Kwara State, Nigeria. I am currently
          serving in Osun State and I am an aspiring Cloud Enginner at AltSchool Africa.

          I joined AltSchool for some reasons, look kinda small but it is
          something really big to me. Firstly, I am scared of life after
          service, what will be of me after this service year. Source of income
          is also one of my reasons, the scholarship program is also like a
          second chance or opportunity for me to pursue my tech carrer as I have
          made an attempt of learning tech during my 200 level days which was
          2018/2019 but due to some circumstances, I could not. Alhamdulillah
          and thanks to AltSchool for this opportunity.
        </p>

          My goals for school of engineering, to be sincere I realised it late
          in university, I wish and i will make the effort to be the BGS of my
          set at school of engineering, maybe even for the whole of AltSchool(we
          have been told there is nothing like that though). I just want to try
          and be best in what I do.
